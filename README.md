Developed a fire detection system using CCTV cameras to enhance public safety and minimize property damage.
The system should be able to accurately detect fire outbreaks in real-time, trigger an alarm to alert authorities, 
and provide visual confirmation through CCTV footage. The solution should be scalable, easy to deploy and operate, 
and reliable in various environmental conditions
